# dpy-boilerplate

Opinionated boilerplate configurations for bots written in Python using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

This project contains 2 boilerplate repositories that you can use to kickstart your Discord bot project(s).

## Choosing between basic and advanced

There are a bunch of distinctions between the 2 configs. The major ones are listed below!

| Feature                 | Basic  | Advanced   |
|-------------------------|:------:|:----------:|
| Cog-based architecture  | ✅     | ✅         |
| Prefix command examples | ✅     | ✅         |
| Slash command examples  | ✅     | ✅         |
| Database                | SQLite | PostgreSQL |
| Logging                 | ❌     | ✅         |
| Client session          | ❌     | ✅         |
| Custom help command     | ❌     | ✅         |
| Dev environment         | ❌     | ✅         |

**TL;DR:** Basic is good for a small scale bot with limited features. Advanced has a lot more options that you'd need when having a bigger feature-set.

Note: If you want to set up basic but want a feature from advanced without its entirity, you can grab it from there with little extra config.
