# dpy-boilerplate

Opinionated boilerplate configurations for bots written in Python using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

This project contains 2 boilerplate repositories that you can use to kickstart your Discord bot project(s).

## Choosing between basic and advanced

There are a bunch of distinctions between the 2 configs. The major ones are listed below!

| Feature                 | Basic              | Advanced           |
|-------------------------|:------------------:|:------------------:|
| Cog-based architecture  | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Prefix command examples | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Slash command examples  | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Database                | SQLite             | PostgreSQL         |
| Logging                 | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Client session          | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Custom help command     | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Dev environment         | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: |

**TL;DR:** Basic is good for a small scale bot with limited features. Advanced has a lot more options that you'd need when having a bigger feature-set.

Note: If you want to set up basic but want a feature from advanced without its entirity, you can grab it from there with little extra config.
